# Project 2: Visual Rhetorical Collage

Your task in this unit is to **make a rhetorical claim through the juxtaposition of images and text.** It's kind of a collage, but a collage with an argument to make. In assigning this, I have two main goals for you: (1) to learn how to ethically obtain images and edit them using digital tools, and (2) to explore the affordances of still images as a medium, and especially their ability to _direct attention_ and _help make ideas memorable_.

As with the sound project, the context for your argument is open: you could be making a social commentary, calling for action, constructing a parody, riffing on a pun, explaining a concept, inviting someone inside, and so on. Whatever you choose, you should consider your audience and what they would find persuasive or interesting, and how you therefore wish to attract and direct their attention.

As you start planning your composition, consider: What ideas do *you* want help remembering? Or what do you want to persuade others of? Is there something you've noticed that you want to bring to the attention of others? See if any terms or images come to mind when you think of your subject, then work back and forth from image to word and back.

## Generative constraints

**Baseline criteria**
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must:

* Use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and/or contrast to focus viewers' attention.
* Include at least one word, with a carefully chosen font, as explained in reflection.
* Have a clear message or intervention
* Incorporate juxtaposition
* Use at least 3 layers
* Use at least 2 GIMP tools, and write about them in the reflection
* Aim for surprise or metaphorical leap in the elements you bring together.
* Argue in reflection why you did what you did

**Aspirational inspirations**
To target (but not guarantee) a grade above a B, the best projects for this unit may...

* Use Github repository with meaningful commit messages
* Incorporate conceptual contrast/changes - (i.e. two separate ideas combined into the image like including at least two images from separate sources)
* Try (and reflect on) ≥ 2 new-to-you GIMP tools/effects
* Guide eye through a flow
* Use negative space actively


## Deadlines and products
At each stage, unless otherwise specified, upload (push) your materials to your own copy of this assignment repository. I recommend that you **save often, using meaningful commit messages**; for best results, please keep your filenames clear, lowercase, and space-free (use hyphens or underscores).

If you are using Box, please nevertheless share a link to your Box folder prominently in your GitHub repository.

| Tues Feb 12 | Visual Rhetoric Proposal | Thinking in writing about what you'd like to do for this assignment.<ul><li> Post to the appropriate Issue Queue with your <strong>proposal</strong>, suggesting in prose the idea or appeal you're hoping to make.</li><li>In the same post, or as a separate file called ASSETS.md, include a <strong>prospective assets chart</strong> (see <em>Writer/Designer</em> p. 149) naming what images you'll need to obtain.</li><li>Please also **link** to your repository in your post.</li></ul> |
| Thurs Feb 14 | Visual Rhetoric Preview | An early snapshot of your progress, to get the gears turning. Turn in: <ul><li> A layered <strong>GIMP project file (.xcf)</strong>, showing the arrangement of your images and text so far (need not be a complete argument or collage yet).</li><li> A static <strong><a href="https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/">screenshot</a> (.png or .jpg)</strong> of your GIMP file in progress (for comparison later to subsequent drafts).</li><li> A plain text (.txt) or markdown (.md) file, explaining in at least 300 words <strong>what you're showing us</strong> in this preview. Feel free also to ask questions or lay out next steps for yourself!</li><li> An updated <strong>ASSETS.md</strong> file, now with the files you actually recorded or otherwise obtained. As you go, add source documentation for any outside sources – and your permission to use them (e.g. licenses, fair use; see <em>Writer/Designer</em> p. 160-165).</li></ul> |
| Tues Feb 19 | Visual Rhetoric Draft | A solid attempt at a complete Visual Rhetorical Argument. Turn in:<ul><li>A layered <strong>GIMP project file (.aup)</strong>, showing the arrangement of your images and any layer effects so far</li><li>At least one more static <strong><a href="https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/">screenshot</a> (.png or .jpg)</strong> of your GIMP file in progress. <ul><li>Think about what moments are worth remembering as you go: where did you level up, or realize something, or get stuck?</li></ul></li><li>An <strong>updated README.md file</strong>, introducing the Visual Rhetorical Argument to a new audience.</li><li>An <strong>updated ASSETS.md file</strong> – or rename it CREDITS.md – including documentation of any outside sources, and your permission to use them (e.g. licenses, fair use); see <em>Writer/Designer</em> p. 160-165.</li></ul>  |
| Sun Feb 24, at 11:59pm | Visual Rhetoric Final Draft | Include the same components as in the earlier draft, but updated. |
| Tues Feb 26 | Visual Rhetoric Reflection | Give a sense of the work you put into your Visual Rhetoric project and whether it accomplishes what you wanted it to.
